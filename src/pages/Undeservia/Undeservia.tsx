          <p>
            You don't deserve love.
            <Notetag idx={1} /> <br />
            You simply don't deserve it. <br />
            You never did.
          </p>

          <p>
            No matter how hard you work, <br />
            you will never save up the wages, <br />
            to pay a fair price for it.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why love terrifies you. <br />
            Why you are up all night, dreading <br />
            the day that the fire cools, <br />
            and your lover walks out the door, <br />
            saying in their head <br />
            what you've always said in yours: <br />
            "I don't deserve this."
          </p>

          <p>
            But that is what love is for. <br />
            It is for the undeservingâ€”
          </p>

          <p>which is everybody.</p>

          <p>
            Nobody pays a fair price for it. <br />
            It is the greatest cheat of life.
          </p>

          <p>
            The world is full of undeserving people <br />
            loving other undeserving people. <br />
            That is why we love. <br />
            That is why we love love.
